`we see that there does seem to be one big positive correlation between two variables`

`the length of membership and the yearly expenditure. In the end we recrate this plot to visualise the regression line.`

`There seem to be little correlation between the time on the desktop website with the amount that clients spend per year.`

`The second graph shows that there seems to be a small correlation between the time spent on the app and the yearly spending.`

`This is probably because these clients tend to spend less time browsing on the phone.`

`Maybe the payment process is faster on the app or the calls-to-action are more successful there.`

`Maybe there is problem in website design or clients spend alot of time to find what they need.`
